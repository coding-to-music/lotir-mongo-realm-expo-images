## What is Lotir ?

I've created this app because I couldn't support sending myself an email to share something on my phone.

Lotir is a simple app that allows you to share images and text between your phone and your computer.

- It's free
- No ads
- Simple to use
- Share text and images
- Temporary : Lotir keep your stuff for 7 days
